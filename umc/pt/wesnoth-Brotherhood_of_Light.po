"This scenario includes a magic system which allows your mages to cast "
"spells. Each spell drains a certain number of mana points - and each player "
"has an individual mana level which gradually replenishes each turn.\n"
"\n"
"By default, each player begins with a maximum mana level of 20 points, and a "
"recovery rate of 2 point per turn. The maximum mana level increases with "
"each levelup, and certain items can raise it as well as the recovery rate. "
"Also, when resting (not attacking nor moving for a turn) you regain 1 point "
"per each movement point instead, meaning that you can recover your mana very "
"quickly by standing still for a few turns.\n"
"<big>II.</big>\n"
"To cast a spell right-click on your mage, choose 'Cast Spell' and a spell "
"menu will appear. Magic upgrades and new spells will be found along the "
"way.\n"
"<big>III.</big>\n"
"After casting a trap-style spell (Bane and Capture) you must right-click "
"anywhere within 4 hexes of your unit and select 'Place Bane/Capture Trap' to "
"place the trap there."
